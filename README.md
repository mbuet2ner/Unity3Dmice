# Unity3Dmice
Software Project University of Oulu. The goal is to create a basic testbed for fast general AI prototyping and testing powered by Unity3D and [Unity Ml-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

## Basic info
The provided RollerAgent project is based on [this](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md) tutorial. More information is available from [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-ML-Agents.md) and [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md).
Some code for the MouseAgent script is derived from [this](http://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/machine-learning-pig-agents-unity) tutorial.

## Used 3D models
The project uses some prebuilt Blender 3D models for fast prototyping and at least somewhat pleasent looks:
